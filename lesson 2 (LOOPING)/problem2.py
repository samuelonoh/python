# TIp : Use 1 while loop and 3 for loops
# 4 spaces : 1 hash
# 3 spaces : 5 hashes
# 2 spaces : 5 hashes
# 1 space : 7 hashes
# o spaces : 9 hashes

# Need to do
# 1. Decrement spaces by 1 each time through the loop
# 2.Increment the hashes by 2 each time through the loop
# 3. Save spaces to the stump by calculating tree height - 1
# 4. Decrement from tree height until it equals 0
# 5. Print spaces and then hashes for each row
# 6. Print stump spaces and then 1 hash

# Get the number of rows for the tree
tree_height = input("How tall is the tree : ")

# Convert into an integer
tree_height = int(tree_height)

# Get the starting spaces for the top of the tree
spaces = tree_height - 1

# There is one hash to start that will be incremented
hashes = 1

# Save stump spaces till later
stump_spaces = tree_height - 1

# Make sure the right number of rowss are printed

# That spaces is decremented by 1 each time
    spaces -= 1

# That hashes is incremented by 2 each time
    hashes += 2

# Decrement tree height each time to jump out of the loop
    tree_height -= 1

# Print the spaces before the stump and then the hash
